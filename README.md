**##Hello Everyone!

My name is Kadhim Al-Kaylani: I'm a BAIS major in my senior year learning the basics of coding and becoming a professional. I was raised in different places around the world, but I consider Dubai, UAE to be my hometown. I am a triplet with a brother and a sister who also attend the University of Iowa. I am excited to learn a lot and to prepare myself for the future!
